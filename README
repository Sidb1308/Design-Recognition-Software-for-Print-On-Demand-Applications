This repository contains a software program developed for Print-On-Demand applications by the startup PRINTAZIX. The software is designed to be installed on a user's computer and facilitates the recognition of specific designs within images, particularly on images with multiple designs. The output of the code is an executable (.exe) file.

Project Overview:

The software utilizes Computer Vision techniques, specifically OpenCV and SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform), for design recognition. By processing two images, one containing various designs and the other containing a specific design, the software identifies and locates the desired design within the image with multiple designs.

Key Features:

Utilizes Computer Vision algorithms for image processing and design recognition.
Implements SIFT for robust feature extraction and matching.
Developed with Python and integrates libraries such as OpenCV, NumPy, and Tkinter for image processing and user interface.
Supports Print-On-Demand applications by facilitating the identification of specific designs.
How to Use:

Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies mentioned in the requirements.txt file.
Execute the program by running the executable file (program.exe).
Follow the on-screen instructions to select the images and initiate the design recognition process.
